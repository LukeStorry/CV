\sect{Previous Development Work}

\zz{Swanbarton - Software Engineer}
{Successfully delivered, and helped design architectures for, a variety of energy management and trading products, as a member of the research \& development team at an energy-storage consultancy.

Given a mixture of legacy code and new designs, my modular, full-stack and test-driven Python code solved problems ranging from cloud-based optimization through to low-level control of industrial batteries.

I also helped transition the software team over to an agile "scrum-ban" approach, by implementing a Jira-based workflow that greatly increased productivity whilst requiring less oversight from management.}
